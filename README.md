- **City Metrics Dashboard**: See how budget decisions affect education quality, public health, infrastructure, safety, environment, and housing
- **AI Budget Advisor**: Get personalized recommendations and explanations for budget decisions
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up/login with Supabase Auth
- **Leaderboard System**: Compete with other users and track your civic engagement skills
- **Personal Dashboard**: Track your simulation history, scores, and achievements

### Technical Features
- **Real-time Calculations**: Instant feedback on budget allocation changes
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Data Persistence**: Save and load budget simulations
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed analytics on user engagement and budget effectiveness

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui components
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## üìä Database Schema

### Tables
- `profiles`: User profile information
- `budget_simulations`: Saved budget allocations and scores
- `leaderboard_entries`: User rankings and scores

### Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- User data is protected and isolated per user
- Secure authentication flow with email confirmation

## üéÆ How It Works

1. **Budget Allocation**: Users distribute $100M across 8 city departments:
   - Education (schools, teachers, programs)
   - Healthcare (hospitals, clinics, public health)
   - Infrastructure (roads, bridges, transit)
   - Public Safety (police, fire, emergency services)
   - Environment (parks, waste management, sustainability)
   - Housing (affordable housing, homeless services)
   - Arts & Culture (museums, libraries, cultural programs)
   - Economic Development (business support, job training)

2. **Real-time Impact**: As users adjust allocations, city metrics update instantly:
   - Education Quality (graduation rates, school performance)
   - Public Health (healthcare access, population health)
   - Infrastructure Quality (road conditions, transit effectiveness)
   - Safety Index (crime prevention, emergency response)
   - Environmental Quality (air quality, green spaces)
   - Housing Affordability (affordable housing availability)

3. **Scoring System**: Overall city score calculated based on balanced allocation and metric performance

4. **AI Guidance**: Intelligent chatbot provides context-aware budget advice and explanations

## üèóÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Supabase account
- Vercel account (for deployment)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd civicsim
   \`\`\`

2. **Install dependencies**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. **Set up Supabase**
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Run the SQL scripts in the `scripts/` folder to set up the database schema
   - Get your project URL and anon key from Supabase dashboard

4. **Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file with:
   \`\`\`
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   \`\`\`

5. **Run the development server**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Database Setup

Run these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL editor:

1. `scripts/001_create_tables.sql` - Creates the main tables and RLS policies
2. `scripts/002_update_leaderboard.sql` - Sets up leaderboard ranking system
